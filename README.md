AI-Powered Legal Companion
Concept Overview
Millions avoid legal help due to shame, high cost, and confusion about legal processes. Courts and lawyers spend vast time extracting basic facts, leading to delays and inefficiency.

This project bridges the gap through an AI-based legal triage assistant.

Problems Addressed
Shame, stigma, and fear (domestic, workplace, abuse issues).​

Expensive lawyer consultations.​

Confusion over legal processes (sections, documents, procedures).​

Delayed justice due to slow fact-extraction in legal workflows.​

Solution: AI-Powered Legal Assistant
Confidential intake: Users explain their situation—no shame, no identity needed.​

Story-mode advice: AI narrates fictional, similar cases to educate (avoiding unauthorized legal practice).​

RAG-powered: Retrieval-Augmented Generation analyzes past cases and probable outcomes.​

Bias/power dynamics aware: Factors in practical realities for tailored guidance.

Automated Legal Formatting: Outputs include relevant sections, acts, and legal procedures.

Structured Case Summary: Conversational data is converted into a lawyer-ready case sheet.

Lawyer Handoff: With user consent, structured summary sent to licensed lawyer to save time.

Live Lawyer Connect: In-app direct messaging/calling with lawyers.

Monetization: Subscription/lead fees for lawyers listed on the platform; AI pre-qualifies clients for them.​
